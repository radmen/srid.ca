# Handling HTTP errors in `req`

The `req` package provides a `MonadHttp` class that has a [`handleHttpException`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/req-3.2.0/docs/Network-HTTP-Req.html#v:handleHttpException) method. The library documentation has this to say in regards to HTTP error handling:

> some people prefer throwing exceptions, while others are concerned with purity. Just define handleHttpException accordingly when making your monad instance of MonadHttp and it will play together seamlessly.

## Define our own monad

We write our Monad by creating a type that wrapps the various [[2012604]] types (including `ReaderT` of [[fca6b335]]), which gets us the appropriate monad instances for free.

```haskell
newtype GitHubT a = GitHubT
  { unGitHubT ::
      ReaderT GitHubTokenResponse (ExceptT GitHubApiError Req) a
  }
  deriving
    ( Applicative,
      Functor,
      Monad,
      MonadIO,
      MonadReader GitHubTokenResponse,
      MonadError GitHubApiError
    )

instance MonadHttp GitHubT where
  handleHttpException e =
    print e >> throwAppError e
    where
      throwAppError = \case
        VanillaHttpException err ->
          throwError $ GitHubApiError_HttpException $ show err
        JsonHttpException err ->
          throwError $ GitHubApiError_BadResponse err

runGitHub :: MonadIO m => GitHubTokenResponse -> GitHubT a -> m (Either GitHubApiError a)
runGitHub tok =
  liftIO
    . runReq defaultHttpConfig
    . runExceptT
    . usingReaderT tok
    . unGitHubT
```

We can then define domain-specific operations on this monad, such as to get the OAuth token as `req`'s `Option` type:

```haskell
authOption :: GitHubT (Option 'Https)
authOption =
  oAuth2Token . encodeUtf8 . _githubTokenResponse_accessToken <$> ask
```

## Exercise for the reader

* How would we achieve this as a Polysemy effect? See [Zulip discussion](https://funprog.srid.ca/polysemy/using-existing-mtl-classes.html).
