# Ka

`ka` is in active research phase, and is highly volatile.

Project goals:

1. Fast build system
2. Extensible via plugins
3. UX optimized for navigating private notebooks

The first two goals in particular are relevant for preparing `ka` to eventually supplant rib and shake in [[neuron]].

## Early Access

[[neuron]] [sponsors] get early access to `ka` source code, which can be utilized to run it locally on your notes. If you are a sponsor, please [email me][email] your GitHub user name - so that I can add you as a repository collaborator.
