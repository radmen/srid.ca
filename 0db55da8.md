# Pure parsing of Dhall file without IO

Dhall's [`input`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dhall-1.33.1/docs/Dhall.html#v:input) function requires IO so as to be able to resolve imports. However, it is not uncommon when using [[6a0a4328]] to not want to support imports in application configuration[^sec].

Here's[^cite] the pure parser for Dhall files, that works similar to `Dhall.input Dhall.auto` but without imports:

```haskell
-- | Pure version of `Dhall.input Dhall.auto`
--
-- The config file cannot have imports, as that requires IO.
parsePure :: forall a. FromDhall a => FilePath -> Text -> Either String a
parsePure fn s = do
  expr0 <- first show $ Dhall.Parser.exprFromText fn s
  expr <- maybeToRight "Cannot have imports" $ traverse (const Nothing) expr0
  void $ first show $ Dhall.TypeCheck.typeOf expr
  first show
    $ validationToEither
    $ Dhall.extract @a Dhall.auto
    $ Dhall.Core.normalize expr
```

[^sec]: It is especially important, for security reasons, to prevent IO when parsing user-submitted Dhall text in the backend.
