# GNOME delights

I use the [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) desktop environment because it provides a delightfully simple interface.

Some of my favourite aspects of GNOME include:

- **Retina display**: GNOME gets 5k retina resolution 27" display right; it just works.

- **PaperWM**: Horizontally scrolling tiling window manager gives you virtually infinite canvas, with sliding viewport controlled via three-finger swipe.
