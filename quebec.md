# Québec

In 2017 I decided to leave the Canadian West, where I had been living for nearly 6 years, and move to the province of [Québec] - with the intention of living in an environment with ambiance different to the one of the Anglophone part of the country.

As an [allophone],[^india] I find the francophone ambiance to be more *warm* and *authentic* compared to Vancouver & Victoria. The people generally demonstrate [joie de vivre] more than a [stiff upper lip] outlook.

[[[z:zettels?tag=Quebec]]]

[^india]: I was born and raised in a southern city of the Indian subcontinent, speaking [Tamil] as the native language, where I lived for 23 years before immigrating to Canada.
