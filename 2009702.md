# Well-being

I used to practice Buddhist meditation which numbed down my emotions, because [[[1de1832a]]]. I now practice the [[[7c5337fc]]] to become happier[^happy] in life.

[^happy]: 
    It has become fashionable in this day and age to express scorn at the prospect of becoming happier (see [[[2eb64d6a]]]); regardless, by "become happier" I refer to maximizing the felicitous and innocuous feelings:  
    > the felicitous feelings are those that are of a happy and carefree (blithesome feelings of great delight and enjoyment) nature; the innocuous feelings are those that are of a harmless and congenial (gracious feelings of ingenuous tranquillity and affability) nature
    
    while minimizing the "good" and the "bad" feelings:
    > the "good" feelings are those that are of a loving (ardent feelings of profound affection and endearment) and a compassionate (empathetic feelings of deep sympathy and commiseration) nature; the "bad" feelings are those that are of a malicious (spiteful feelings of intense hatred and resentment) and a sorrowful (melancholy feelings of yawning sadness and grief) nature
