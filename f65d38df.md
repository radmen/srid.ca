# WIP: Using NixOS in X1 Carbon Gen 7

:::{.ui .message}
This is [**work in progress**]{.ui .red .text} note. Ultimately it will be split into individual notes, and put under [[x1c7]].
:::

I recently purchased a Thinkpad X1 Carbon (Gen 7, with 10th gen processor)[^tw1] and installed [[c7170724]] on it.

## Setting up Linux

I used [these instructions](https://github.com/andywhite37/nixos/blob/master/DUAL_BOOT_WINDOWS_GUIDE.md)[^nat] to install NixOS alongside Windows.

[^nat]: Note that you can use the builtin Windows disk manager to resize the partition. No need to install a third party app as this article indicates.

Note the following:

- Disable Secure Boot in BIOS. NixOS won't boot otherwise.
- Use nixos-unstable and choose the latest kernel (`linuxPackages_latest`)

As usual, refer to [the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_7)) for details.

See my [configuration.nix][x1c7.nix] for full NixOS config.

## What works

- Hi-res display
  - 4k resolution
  - 5k resolution via thunderbolt
  	- requires 5.9 kernel (`linuxPackages_testing` on NixOS), or [this patch][edd]
    - Netflix videos can be choppy; `mpv` works well though.
  - GNOME selects 200% scaling for both
- Audio
- Microphone (and Yeti microphone)
- Fingerprint reader
  - Works in both login screen & command-line sudo
- Suspend
- Web camera
- Trackpad
  - Nearly as good as that of a Macbook

## Stability issues

- Audio via **LG Ultrafine 5k monitor**": system freeze after screen goes blank but only if audio is plugged to the back of the LG Ultrafine 5k monitor.
  - Not an issue when the audio is *directly* plugged to the second Thunderbolt port.
- WiFi periodic interruption
  - [See reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/iu1de6/x1_carbon_w_5k_monitor_running_linux/g5ijbw9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3); Looks to be [this bug](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203709).
  - This is the most annoying problem with the X1C7. It vanishes for some days, before returning.

## Software issues

I enjoy using GNOME (see [[18084e45]]), but these issues prevent it from being perfect:

- Trackpad gestures, such as two-finger swipe to go back, do not work on web browsers, with the exception of GNOME Web (which has [buggy][gnome-web-bug] hardware acceleration)
- **Google Chrome** is slow and laggy. **Chromium** works fine, though.
- [**Redshift**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Redshift) will not work on Wayland; and GNOME's night light is [broken](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon/-/issues/39) on 5k tiled display.
  - However, is night mode [all it's cracked up to be][night-light]?

## Performance

Performance is reasonably good for both home-office and coffee-shop use. The carbon does suffer a bit with some long compilation (eg: GHCJS) tasks, however I can offload that to my workstation at home (via manual ssh or [distributed](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Distributed_build) build), and then use its binary cache ([see here](https://twitter.com/sridca/status/1308808239677571072)). Per the pareto principle, the carbon is still a delight to use. Also vscode remote enables seamless development of remote repositories as if one is developping locally.

## Battery Life

Never measured. But looks to be around 6 hours (more than enough for me). I used the default [nixos-hardware] configuration; and reddit has [some tips][bat-red]. A fellow programmer reported [5 hours][bat-5h].

## Next computer

My next computer, if I choose to buy one in ~3 years, will be similar to the X1C7 but with a bit more performance (assuming battery life does not suffer); i.e., if I were to make this decision again, I'd consider Thinkpad X1E or P1 - but with integrated graphics (nvidia has poor support on Linux).
