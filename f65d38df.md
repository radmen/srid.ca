# X1 Carbon Gen 7 + NixOS

:::{.ui .message}
This note will become a **blog post** once all the needed configuration is done, as well as sufficient period has passed to form a well founded opinion of the device. Until then, it should be considered a [**work in progress**]{.ui .red .text}.
:::

I recently purchased a Thinkpad X1 Carbon (Gen 7, with 10th gen processor)[^tw1] and installed [[c7170724]] on it. 

[^tw1]: <https://twitter.com/sridca/status/1304155221183131648>

## Setting up Linux

I used [these instructions](https://github.com/andywhite37/nixos/blob/master/DUAL_BOOT_WINDOWS_GUIDE.md)[^nat] to install NixOS alongside Windows.

[^nat]: Note that you can use the builtin Windows disk manager to resize the partition. No need to install a third party app as this article indicates.

Note the following:

- Disable Secure Boot in BIOS. NixOS won't boot otherwise.
- Use nixos-unstable and choose the latest kernel (`linuxPackages_latest`)

As usual, refer [the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_7)) for details.

See my [configuration.nix](https://github.com/srid/nix-config/blob/master/nixos-configuration/x1c7.nix) for full NixOS config.

## What works

- 4k resolution
  - GNOME selects 200% scaling, which is perfect for the Carbon
- Audio
- Microphone (and Yeti microphone)
- Thunderbolt, with 5k resolution in LG Ultrafine 5k monitor
  - requires 5.9 kernel (`linuxPackages_testing` on NixOS), or [this patch][edd]
- Fingerprint reader
  - Works in both login screen & command-line sudo
- Suspend
- Web camera
- Trackpad
  - Nearly as good as that of a Macbook

## Stability issues

- Sometimes system freezes after screen goes blank/ suspends if Thunderbolt is plugged *and* audio is playing. Hard reboot afterwards.
- WiFi periodic interruption. [Most annoying problem]{.ui .red .text}!
  - [See reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/iu1de6/x1_carbon_w_5k_monitor_running_linux/g5ijbw9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
  - Looks to be [this bug](https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=203709)
    - Trying the workarounds mentioned in that link has substantially reduced the frequency of the problem.


## Software issues

I enjoy using GNOME (see [[18084e45]]), but these issues prevent it from being perfect:

- Trackpad gestures, such as two-finger swipe to go back, do not work on web browsers, with the exception of GNOME Web (which has [buggy][gnome-web-bug] hardware acceleration)
- **Google Chrome** is slow and laggy. **Chromium** works fine, though.
- [**Redshift**](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Redshift) will not work on Wayland; and GNOME's night light is [broken](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-settings-daemon/-/issues/39) on 5k tiled display.
  - However, is night mode [all it's cracked up to be][night-light]?

## Performance

Performance is reasonably good for both home-office and coffee-shop use. The carbon does suffer a bit with some long compilation (eg: GHCJS) tasks, however I can offload that to my workstation at home (via manual ssh or [distributed](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Distributed_build) build), and then use its binary cache ([see here](https://twitter.com/sridca/status/1308808239677571072)). Per the pareto principle, the carbon is still a delight to use.

## Battery Life

Never measured. But looks to be around 6 hours (more than enough for me). I used the default [nixos-hardware] configuration; and reddit has [some tips][bat-red]. A fellow programmer reported [5 hours][bat-5h].
