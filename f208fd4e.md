# Installing NixOS on X1 Carbon Gen 7

I used [these instructions](https://github.com/andywhite37/nixos/blob/master/DUAL_BOOT_WINDOWS_GUIDE.md)[^nat] to install NixOS alongside Windows.

[^nat]: Note that you can use the builtin Windows disk manager to resize the partition. No need to install a third party app as this article indicates.

Note the following:

- Disable Secure Boot in BIOS. NixOS won't boot otherwise.
- Use nixos-unstable and choose the latest kernel (`linuxPackages_latest`)

As usual, refer to [the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Lenovo_ThinkPad_X1_Carbon_(Gen_7)) for details.

See my [configuration.nix][x1c7.nix] for full NixOS config.
