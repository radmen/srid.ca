Haskell's <58bc09d0?cf> support is not perfect, yet. 

Although there is no concrete data on it, it is widely believed that lack of perfect IDE support is a significant factor in Haskell not seeing adoption. There were several discussions about this, for example:

* reddit: [Why is this so hard?](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/gzxghn/why_is_this_so_hard/)
* [*Now that #Haskell has an easy to install "good IDE" - where have the "Haskell just needs..." goal posts shifted to??*](https://twitter.com/puffnfresh/status/1309770137960996866)
