# Uncloud your software

The **goal** of this project is to eliminate one's dependency on external services, notably Google, such that no matter what these technology companies do, one retains one's data for lifetime.

I'm currently dependent on Google for the following services. If Google chooses to [lock my account indefinitely](http://web.archive.org/web/20201102161748/https://www.businessinsider.com/google-users-locked-out-after-years-2020-10) I'd permanently lose access to my data. So it is important to find replacements.

Replacement software should be either self-hostable or be desktop software that works locally (with the data synchronized using something like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/)).

## Areas

### Email

- [ ] Email has to be hosted by somebody else for reliability, but to minimize the damage I must use my own domain but not as an alias; as well use a local email client to store email archives locally. 

### Passwords

- [ ] Find a solution with sync.
  - Explore [KeePass & Syncthing](https://dev.to/rusty_sys_dev/switching-to-keepass-and-syncthing-for-password-management-1klh)
  
### Docs (spreadsheets)

- [ ] Find a spreadsheet software, or design a custom app, for personal accounting.
  - Research [OnlyOffice](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors)
