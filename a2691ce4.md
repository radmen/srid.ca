# Introducing filesystem hierarchy support in Ka

I had new requirement for [[ka]] when working with my private notebook: **archive old notes** (esp. daily notes) whilst still being able to access and link to them.

Instead of writing a specialized archive plugin, I decided to take a more general approach: if ka supported reading notes from the *whole directory tree*, then I can move note files to any sub-directory, and write a small plugin that will treat a pre-defined directory as containing archived notes (the UI can then hide these notes from sidebar listing).

The primary reason for going with this general approach is that it is **quite simple from an UX point of view**, involving little complication. Another reason is that it also enables categorizing notes into different buckets -- for eg., work related notes can be put under the ./Work directory. This also enables the sidebar UI to present a tree view for navigating notes.

Of course, our notebook is still interlinked Zettelkasten-style. Notes from any directory can link to notes from any other directory. To this end, linking to ./Foo/Bar/SomeNote.md is done via `[[SomeNote]]`--i.e; a note is identified by its filename, and not its position in the directory hierarchy.
