# Using Twitter sensibly 

I'm not a huge fan of Twitter for several reasons; however, there is one good reason to be on Twitter: **social engagement**.[^not-just-twitter]

[^not-just-twitter]: Of course that can be said for any platform where people participate and interact with one another: reddit, Zulip, Slack, Discord, etc.

## Twitter codes

- Use it mostly for creative or interesting content 
  - Twitter is unsuited[^anon] for [[1f881332]].
- Mute people who tweet with [a negative vibe](https://twitter.com/sridca/status/1317153011169398784).[^vibe]
  - This is especially the case with the "[woke](https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-woke-wokeness/)" crowd.
- Above all, use it for interacting with people, encouraging a felicitous, innocuous and learning ambiance.

[^vibe]: Appearing negative (eg: when criticizing something) is not the same thing as emanating a negative **vibe**. See [Experimental evidence of massive-scale emotional contagion through social networks](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788). Cf. [[2015101]]. 

## Tools

- Remove distracting rubbish[^clickbait]
  - On desktop, use [Minimal Twitter](https://github.com/thomaswang/minimal-twitter)
  - On mobile, ... ?

[^clickbait]: Especially the clickbait content that Twitter forces into your valuable attention.

[^anon]: If you really must make your unpopular opinions known, [do it anonymously](https://uglyduck.ca/blog-anonymously/) to [isolate yourself from online mobs](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23789621).
