# Flow is addictive

[Flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)) is an addictive state. So you are feeling good, then get into flow (some project or whatever) ... and at the end, there is a 'come down' (not unlike a drug!) ... by then the original state of feeling good is lost, and you find yourself *craving* to resurrect flow again. 

So an answer to "Why appreciate?" in the enjoy-and-appreciate of [[7c5337fc]] is that - appreciating feeling good (for example) reinforces the sensibility of feeling good (for example) explicitly in memory, such that it becomes *less* likely to be overriden (forgotten) by a future-state of good feeling overriding that sensibility.
